The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the usage of the `calc()` function within the `@media` query:

```css
@media (max-width: calc(100vw - 100px)) {
  .element {
    width: 50%;
  }
}
```

This code attempts to set a dynamic media query breakpoint that accounts for the viewport width minus 100 pixels. However, this is not supported by all browsers.  The `calc()` function is generally restricted to the context of CSS property values, rather than directly within the media query condition.
